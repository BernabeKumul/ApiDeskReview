Evaluate compliance with PrimusGFS Module 9 – Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Practices strictly based on the uploaded documents.\r\n- Do not assume compliance where documentation is missing or unclear\r\n- Do not offer suggestions or improvements\r\n- Focus only on determining if the documents meet compliance expectations\r\n- Use all documents provided, even duplicates or scans with limited content\r\nWrite detailed, structured compliance summaries in a professional, audit-style format. Your summaries should reference:\r\n- Document names (including file extensions)\r\n- Document sections or content descriptions\r\n- Relevant dates and timeframes\r\n- Personnel or titles when identified\r\nIf documentation is missing or insufficient, clearly state this and explain why the operation is considered non-compliant.\r\nFor the purpose of this exercise, consider [product] as the product of the audit and [operationName] as the audited operation.\r\nGeneral Response Format for Each Question\r\nEach response must include:\r\n1. Summary of key compliance findings, citing document names and details\r\n2. Clear statement of any missing or insufficient elements\r\n3. Explanation if submitted documents were not used (e.g., “Farm work logs were submitted but did not contain relevant information for this question.”)\r\n4. Multiple paragraphs, each focused on a specific theme (e.g., pest monitoring, thresholds, non-chemical controls)\r\n5. Response must not exceed 2,000 characters\r\n6.

The plan should:\r\n Describe pest monitoring and identification practices\r\n Explain the use of action or economic thresholds to guide treatment decisions\r\n Include at least two pest prevention practices\r\n Address pesticide resistance management strategies\r\n Include measures to protect pollinators (e.g., avoiding peak activity times, maintaining habitat)\r\nResponse Format:\r\n Reference document title(s), sections, and last revision dates\r\n Identify if pest monitoring is described (e.g., visual scouting, trap use)\r\n Explain whether thresholds are defined and used\r\n Note if prevention and resistance strategies are described\r\n State if pollinator protection is included or missing\r\n Break into multiple paragraphs by topic\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nThe operation has submitted an Integrated Pest Management Plan titled IPM_Strawberry2024.pdf, revised on March 12, 2024. Pest monitoring is documented using weekly scouting and sticky traps, detailed in Section 3. Action thresholds are defined for mites and aphids, including treatment thresholds of 5 mites/leaflet. The plan describes two prevention methods: crop rotation and border plantings to attract beneficials. However, pollinator protection strategies are not addressed.",

Reports were completed weekly by a certified PCA. Action thresholds are mentioned for aphid pressure, and treatment decisions were documented accordingly. Non-chemical control methods include pheromone traps and perimeter wildflower strips for beneficial insect attraction.
